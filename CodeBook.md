Data: Data_Summarise

Variables:

activity: this variable shows what type of activity 30 volunteers are doing . Class character

subjects: this variable shows the descriptive on individual which was a group of 30 volunteers for this experiment. Class int. The number in this variable shows a volunteer.
          For instance, 1 is volunteer 1, 2 is volunteer 2
